        <p>• <b>Rabindranath Tagore</b>,(in Bengali Rabīndranāth Ṭhākur), born on May 7,1861, Calcutta [now Kolkata],India.—died August 7, 1941, Calcutta)was a Bengali polymath who worked as a poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer and painter.He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of Gitanjali,he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal.He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as "the Bard of Bengal", Tagore was known by sobriquets: <b>Gurudev, Kobiguru, Biswakobi</b>.</p>
        <p>• A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name.</p>
        <p>• Rabindranath Tagore wrote the national anthems of two countries, India and Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>• <b>"Jana Gana Mana"</b> (Bengali: জন গণ মন) is the national anthem of the Republic of India. It was originally composed as "Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata" in Bengali by polymath Rabindranath Tagore.</p>
        <p>• Bangladesh's national anthem titled <b>“Amar Shonar Bangla”</b> was penned by Rabindranath Tagore in 1905. The melody of the song was adopted from Gagan Harkara's song <i>“Ami Kothay Pabo Tare”</i>.</p>
